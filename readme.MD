This was inspired by the [gitster](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/External-themes#gitster) and [pi](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/External-themes#pi) themes.

## Installation
1. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#basic-installation)
2. `mkdir $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes` if it doesn't exist already.
3. Download or clone `flower.zsh-theme`
4. `mv <path>/flower.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/flower.zsh-theme` to move the downloaded file into the themes directory. Replace `<path>` with the path to the file.
5. `vim ~/.zshrc`
6. Set `ZSH_THEME="pi"`
4. Restart your terminal to see changes.

## To get the color scheme
I'm using the [Bright Lights](https://github.com/lysyi3m/macos-terminal-themes/blob/master/schemes/Bright%20Lights.terminal) iTerm2 color scheme. Instructions for how to use are [here](https://github.com/lysyi3m/macos-terminal-themes).
